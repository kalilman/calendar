# Calendar Project

This repository contains design artefacts for a calendar and study system. The files in `docs/phase0` cover Phase 0 of the project as outlined in the build playbook.

A minimal HTML/JS prototype of the calendar UI lives in the `ui` directory. Open `ui/index.html` in a browser to try the basic day/week/month views and event editing.
